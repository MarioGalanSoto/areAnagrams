<h1>areAnagrams</h1>

<h2>Overview:</h2>

The areAnagrams project is a JavaScript utility that provides a function for checking whether two words are anagrams. Anagrams are words that have the same characters with the same frequencies, but possibly in a different order. This utility is designed to be flexible, case-insensitive, and easily integrable into other JavaScript projects.

<h2>Usage:</h2>

<h3>Instalation:</h3>

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine

<h3>How to use:</h3>

Clone or download the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/MarioGalanSoto/areAnagrams.git
```

Navigate to the project directory

npm install
```

Use the areAnagrams function in your JavaScript code

```
const { areAnagrams } = require('./areAnagrams/areAnagrams.js');

// Example usage:
const result = areAnagrams('listen', 'silent');

```

<h2>Testing:</h2>

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```
npx mocha test.js
```

<h2>Functionality:</h2>
The areAnagrams function checks whether two input words are anagrams, returning true if they are and false otherwise. The function is case-insensitive and handles various scenarios, including empty strings and words with different lengths.

<h2>Test Cases:</h2>
The project includes a set of test cases to ensure the correctness of the areAnagrams function. These tests cover anagrams, non-anagrams, case-insensitivity, empty strings, and different word lengths.
